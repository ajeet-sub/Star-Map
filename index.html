          Today marks our 2nd Valentine's day together! When writing this, a lot of things coursed through my mind, but in the end, everything converged to one thing: solace. Whenever
          I'm with you, there isn't a moment where I feel comfort. I feel safe to be myself, safe to be silly, and most of all, safe to love you. Loving you has been indescribable, and I wouldn't 
          trade it for the anything in the whole world. Your innate ability to make me laugh, remove my sadness, motivate me to improve, and make me sleepy (cuddles never fail) are things that I am forever
          grateful for, as it is something I only feel when with you. While it is only our 2nd Valentine's day, the moments we have shared together are already worth a lifetime, and I can't wait
          to share many more with you. You are the love of my life and my Valentine (thank you for saying yes :)).
          <div class="intro-divider"></div>
          With that being said, I do wish you wouldn't second guess yourself as much, because you are incredible (are you or are you). I am so proud of you for all that you have achieved not just in these past couple years, but also throughout your
          whole life. You are the smartest person I know, and I am so grateful that I get
          to join you in this adventure of life as you pursue all the heights that you dream of reaching. I hope that you enjoy this
          little memoir of your accomplishments now and in the future (because you are going to get there). Whenever you feel like you're not good enough or you might not be smart enough for something, feel free
          to look at this map to understand that you are capable, as you have done enough to illuminate even a dark sky.
